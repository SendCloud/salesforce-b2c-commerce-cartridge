# link_sendcloud

## Summary
Sendcloud is a shipping service provider that links multiple logistics service providers to web stores, WMS and ERP systems. The service is primarily used by online retailers to automate the shipping process.

The Sendcloud LINK cartridge contains all modifications needed to integrate Salesforce B2C Commerce with Sendcloud.

A Sendcloud account is needed when using the cartridge. Clients may use this LINK cartridge to ensure a quick and hassle-free time-to-market, but there is no requirement for clients to use this cartridge: they can also choose not to use this cartridge at all, or only use parts of it.

## Documentation

Please see the cartridge documentation (in the documentation sub folder) for functionality and installation instructions.
